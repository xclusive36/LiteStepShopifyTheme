### Summary

Formatted three section schemas for Theme Check compliance and added missing JSON templates required by Online Store 2.0. This PR includes small maintenance edits and placeholder templates to satisfy theme-check locally.

### Changes
- Formatted section schema JSON for header, hero, collection
- Added missing template JSON files and adjusted settings/locales

### Validation
- Ran `theme-check` locally â€” 43 files inspected, 0 offenses.
- ESLint run locally with no JS errors.

### Notes
- Quickview/cart UI remains a skeleton; follow-up work recommended.
